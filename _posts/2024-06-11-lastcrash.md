[LastCrash](https://lastcrash.io) is a crash video replay SDK for iOS and Android apps.  See exactly what happened in the moments that led to a crash.

Stop wondering what the steps were to reproduce a crash.  Watch what the user experienced so you can quickly resolve the problem.

In addition to crash video, LastCrash uses AI to summarize complex stack traces and log output to clearly explain what might have happened.

The SDK can also detect freeze moments when the app becomes unresponsive.  Freezes are early indicators of a potential crash.  Watch video of what led to an app freeze, a report on main thread state and an AI summary of what might have caused the freeze.

Learn more about additional features like network monitoring and real-time analytics platform at [lastcrash.io](https://lastcrash.io).

This is one of the several things I've been working on for the past few months at [Pocket Labs](https://pocketlabs.io).  Check it out!
