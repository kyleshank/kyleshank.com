I have added Markdown support in Anatype 1.2 now released to the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anatype/id6755091612?mt=12).

Markdown syntax will now be highlighted.  Additionally, there is a live preview of the rendered Markdown that can be toggled on or off by going to View > Toggle Preview or by the keystroke Command-M.  I really like the fullscreen editing and previewing experience.

Video demonstration coming soon on the [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/shanksoft).
