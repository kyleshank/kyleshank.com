[Anatype](https://anatype.com) now has a very simple timer feature to pace your writing.  You can easily start a 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 or 60 minute timer from the menu or with a key command.  Simply select from the Timer menu to start one.  You'll hear a sound of a timer starting when initiated and an  ending sound when time is up.

If you haven't noticed, I created Anatype to help me focus and write more.
